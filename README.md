# mh-poweruser-qol

A collection of mini-scripts to improve QoL in MouseHunt. I'm just dabbling in this so cannot offer much support.

Functions:
1. Adds a button to show the number of friends online in each location, highlighting the current location in red.
    
    a. Known issue: button disappears if camp section is reloaded without refreshing the entire page  
    b. Known issue: current location highlighting doesn't work if in the Twisted side of the the LG complex

2. Adds quick-search by Hunter ID to the sidebar
3. Inbox button skips to General tab and deletes Daily Draw elements.
